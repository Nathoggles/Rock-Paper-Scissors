A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game following The Odin Project assignments (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). 
Still, since the assignments were basic by purpose (which stimulates thinking a lot!), it's my fourth day of learning to code and I mostly did it myself (with only several of my questions glanced for at the JS documentation and openstack and documented in the WIP section), I'm proud AF. So here we are.
